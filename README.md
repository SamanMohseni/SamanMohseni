👋 Hi, I'm Seyedsaman Mohsenisangtabi (@samanmohseni)  
🎓 I recently completed my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a focus on Computer Systems' Architecture at Sharif University of Technology  
🔍 My research interests include Hardware-Software Codesign, Domain-Specific Accelerator Design, and Memory-Intensive Computation Acceleration  
🛠️ I have developed a flexible compressed DNN training framework, capable of training robust DNNs under various constraints, and I am involved in designing hardware architectures optimized for DNN inference and training  
📝 I'm excited about the potential of dynamically reconfigurable computing and systematic hardware design
